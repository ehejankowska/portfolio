## About me

My name is Ewa Hejankowska. I graduated with a master's degree from the University of Szczecin, Faculty of Economic Sciences and Management. For 12 years of my career I have been working in the HR area.
Currently, I would like to change my career path to the IT (software testing), which offers many opportunities for growth. First step to get knowledge and skills was to participate in a testing workshop organized by DareIT.
